# Recursion-Lab
Write a recursive method to sum the values in an array of integers.  
Create a file ArraySum.java and add the recursive method: public int sumOfArray (Integer[] a,int index).
Note that ‘a’ is an array of type Integer that is specified in the driver file, and ‘index’ is an integer that shows which number in the array to sum next.
